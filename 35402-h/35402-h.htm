<h2>DEDICATORY EPISTLE</h2>


<p>To my best and dearest friend I dedicate the first collected edition of
my poems, and to him I address what I have to say on the occasion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will agree with me that it is impossible for any man to undertake
the task of commentary, however brief and succinct, on anything he has
done or tried to do, without incurring the charge of egoism. But there
are two kinds of egoism, the furtive and the frank: and the outspoken
and open-hearted candour of Milton and Wordsworth, Corneille and Hugo,
is not the least or the lightest of their claims to the regard as well
as the respect or the reverence of their readers. Even if I were worthy
to claim kinship with the lowest or with the highest of these deathless
names, I would not seek to shelter myself under the shadow of its
authority. The question would still remain open on all sides. Whether it
is worth while for any man to offer any remarks or for any other man to
read his remarks on his own work, his own ambition, or his own attempts,
he cannot of course determine. If there are great examples of abstinence
from such a doubtful enterprise, there are likewise great examples to
the contrary. As long as the writer can succeed in evading the kindred
charges and the cognate risks of vanity and humility, there can be no
reason why he should not undertake it. And when he has nothing to regret
and nothing to recant, when he finds nothing that he could wish to
cancel, to alter, or to unsay, in any page he has ever laid before his
reader, he need not be seriously troubled by the inevitable
consciousness that the work of his early youth is not and cannot be
unnaturally unlike the work of a very young man. This would be no excuse
for it, if it were in any sense bad work: if it be so, no apology would
avail; and I certainly have none to offer.</p>

<p>It is now thirty-six years since my first volume of miscellaneous verse,
lyrical and dramatic and elegiac and generally heterogeneous, had as
quaint a reception and as singular a fortune as I have ever heard or
read of. I do not think you will differ from my opinion that what is
best in it cannot be divided from what is not so good by any other line
of division than that which marks off mature from immature execution&mdash;in
other words, complete from incomplete conception. For its author the
most amusing and satisfying result of the clatter aroused by it was the
deep diversion of collating and comparing the variously inaccurate
verdicts of the scornful or mournful censors who insisted on regarding
all the studies of passion or sensation attempted or achieved in it as
either confessions of positive fact or excursions of absolute fancy.
There are photographs from life in the book; and there are sketches from
imagination. Some which keen-sighted criticism has dismissed with a
smile as ideal or imaginary were as real and actual as they well could
be: others which have been taken for obvious transcripts from memory
were utterly fantastic or dramatic. If the two kinds cannot be
distinguished, it is surely rather a credit than a discredit to an
artist whose medium or material has more in common with a musician's
than with a sculptor's. Friendly and kindly critics, English and
foreign, have detected ignorance of the subject in poems taken straight
from the life, and have protested that they could not believe me were I
to swear that poems entirely or mainly fanciful were not faithful
expressions or transcriptions of the writer's actual experience and
personal emotion. But I need not remind you that all I have to say about
this book was said once for all in the year of its publication: I have
nothing to add to my notes then taken, and I have nothing to retract
from them. To parade or to disclaim experience of passion or of sorrow,
of pleasure or of pain, is the habit and the sign of a school which has
never found a disciple among the better sort of English poets, and which
I know to be no less pitifully contemptible in your opinion than in
mine.</p>

<p>In my next work it should be superfluous to say that there is no touch
of dramatic impersonation or imaginary emotion. The writer of 'Songs
before Sunrise,' from the first line to the last, wrote simply in
submissive obedience to Sir Philip Sidney's precept&mdash;'Look in thine
heart, and write.' The dedication of these poems, and the fact that the
dedication was accepted, must be sufficient evidence of this. They do
not pretend and they were never intended to be merely the metrical
echoes, or translations into lyric verse, of another man's doctrine.
Mazzini was no more a Pope or a Dictator than I was a parasite or a
papist. Dictation and inspiration are rather different things. These
poems, and others which followed or preceded them in print, were
inspired by such faith as is born of devotion and reverence: not by such
faith, if faith it may be called, as is synonymous with servility or
compatible with prostration of an abject or wavering spirit and a
submissive or dethroned intelligence. You know that I never pretended to
see eye to eye with my illustrious friends and masters, Victor Hugo and
Giuseppe Mazzini, in regard to the positive and passionate confidence of
their sublime and purified theology. Our betters ought to know better
than we: they would be the last to wish that we should pretend to their
knowledge, or assume a certitude which is theirs and is not ours. But on
one point we surely cannot but be at one with them: that the spirit and
the letter of all other than savage and barbarous religions are
irreconcilably at variance, and that prayer or homage addressed to an
image of our own or of other men's making, be that image avowedly
material or conventionally spiritual, is the affirmation of idolatry
with all its attendant atrocities, and the negation of all belief, all
reverence, and all love, due to the noblest object of human worship that
humanity can realise or conceive. Thus much the exercise of our common
reason might naturally suffice to show us: but when its evidence is
confirmed and fortified by the irrefragable and invariable evidence of
history, there is no room for further dispute or fuller argument on a
subject now visibly beyond reach and eternally beyond need of debate or
demonstration. I know not whether it may or may not be worth while to
add that every passing word I have since thought fit to utter on any
national or political question has been as wholly consistent with the
principles which I then did my best to proclaim and defend as any
apostasy from the faith of all republicans in the fundamental and final
principle of union, voluntary if possible and compulsory if not, would
have been ludicrous in the impudence of its inconsistency with those
simple and irreversible principles. Monarchists and anarchists may be
advocates of national dissolution and reactionary division: republicans
cannot be. The first and last article of their creed is unity: the most
grinding and crushing tyranny of a convention, a directory, or a despot,
is less incompatible with republican faith than the fissiparous
democracy of disunionists or communalists.</p>

<p>If the fortunes of my lyrical work were amusingly eccentric and
accidental, the varieties of opinion which have saluted the appearance
of my plays have been, or have seemed to my humility, even more
diverting and curious. I have been told by reviewers of note and
position that a single one of them is worth all my lyric and otherwise
undramatic achievements or attempts: and I have been told on equal or
similar authority that, whatever I may be in any other field, as a
dramatist I am demonstrably nothing. My first if not my strongest
ambition was to do something worth doing, and not utterly unworthy of a
young countryman of Marlowe the teacher and Webster the pupil of
Shakespeare, in the line of work which those three poets had left as a
possibly unattainable example for ambitious Englishmen. And my first
book, written while yet under academic or tutorial authority, bore
evidence of that ambition in every line. I should be the last to deny
that it also bore evidence of the fact that its writer had no more
notion of dramatic or theatrical construction than the authors of
'Tamburlaine the Great,' 'King Henry VI.,' and 'Sir Thomas Wyatt.' Not
much more, you may possibly say, was discernible in 'Chastelard': a play
also conceived and partly written by a youngster not yet emancipated
from servitude to college rule. I fear that in the former volume there
had been little if any promise of power to grapple with the realities
and subtleties of character and of motive: that whatever may be in it of
promise or of merit must be sought in the language and the style of such
better passages as may perhaps be found in single and separable speeches
of Catherine and of Rosamond. But in 'Chastelard' there are two figures
and a sketch in which I certainly seem to see something of real and
evident life. The sketch of Darnley was afterwards filled out and
finished in the subsequent tragedy of 'Bothwell.' That ambitious,
conscientious, and comprehensive piece of work is of course less
properly definable as a tragedy than by the old Shakespearean term of a
chronicle history. The radical difference between tragic history and
tragedy of either the classic or the romantic order, and consequently
between the laws which govern the one and the principles which guide the
other, you have yourself made clear and familiar to all capable
students. This play of mine was not, I think, inaccurately defined as an
epic drama in the French verses of dedication which were acknowledged by
the greatest of all French poets in a letter from which I dare only
quote one line of Olympian judgment and godlike generosity. 'Occuper ces
deux cimes, cela n'est donn&eacute; qu'&agrave; vous.' Nor will I refrain from the
confession that I cannot think it an epic or a play in which any one
part is sacrificed to any other, any subordinate figure mishandled or
neglected or distorted or effaced for the sake of the predominant and
central person. And, though this has nothing or less than nothing to do
with any question of poetic merit or demerit, of dramatic success or
unsuccess, I will add that I took as much care and pains as though I had
been writing or compiling a history of the period to do loyal justice to
all the historic figures which came within the scope of my dramatic or
poetic design. There is not one which I have designedly altered or
intentionally modified: it is of course for others to decide whether
there is one which is not the living likeness of an actual or imaginable
man.</p>

<p>The third part of this trilogy, as far as I know or remember, found
favour only with the only man in England who could speak on the subject
of historic drama with the authority of an expert and a master. The
generally ungracious reception of 'Mary Stuart' gave me neither surprise
nor disappointment: the cordial approbation or rather the generous
applause of Sir Henry Taylor gave me all and more than all the
satisfaction I could ever have looked for in recompense of as much
painstaking and conscientious though interesting and enjoyable work as
can ever, I should imagine, have been devoted to the completion of any
comparable design. Private and personal appreciation I have always
thought and often found more valuable and delightful than all possible
or imaginable clamour of public praise. This preference will perhaps be
supposed to influence my opinion if I avow that I think I have never
written anything worthier of such reward than the closing tragedy which
may or may not have deserved but which certainly received it.</p>

<p>My first attempt to do something original in English which might in some
degree reproduce for English readers the likeness of a Greek tragedy,
with possibly something more of its true poetic life and charm than
could have been expected from the authors of 'Caractacus' and 'Merope,'
was perhaps too exuberant and effusive in its dialogue, as it certainly
was too irregular in the occasional license of its choral verse, to
accomplish the design or achieve the success which its author should
have aimed at. It may or may not be too long as a poem: it is, I fear,
too long for a poem of the kind to which it belongs or aims at
belonging. Poetical and mathematical truth are so different that I
doubt, however unwilling I may naturally be to doubt, whether it can
truthfully be said of 'Atalanta in Calydon' that the whole is greater
than any part of it. I hope it may be, and I can honestly say no more.
Of 'Erechtheus' I venture to believe with somewhat more confidence that
it can. Either poem, by the natural necessity of its kind and structure,
has its crowning passage or passages which cannot, however much they may
lose by detachment from their context, lose as much as the crowning
scene or scenes of an English or Shakespearean play, as opposed to an
&AElig;schylean or Sophoclean tragedy, must lose and ought to lose by a
similar separation. The two best things in these two Greek plays, the
antiphonal lamentation for the dying Meleager and the choral
presentation of stormy battle between the forces of land and sea, lose
less by such division from the main body of the poem than would those
scenes in 'Bothwell' which deal with the turning-point in the life of
Mary Stuart on the central and conclusive day of Carberry Hill.</p>

<p>It might be thought pedantic or pretentious in a modern poet to divide
his poems after the old Roman fashion into sections and classes; I must
confess that I should like to see this method applied, were it but by
way of experiment in a single edition, to the work of the leading poets
of our own country and century: to see, for instance, their lyrical and
elegiac works ranged and registered apart, each kind in a class of its
own, such as is usually reserved, I know not why, for sonnets only. The
apparent formality of such an arrangement as would give us, for
instance, the odes of Coleridge and Shelley collected into a distinct
reservation or division might possibly be more than compensated to the
more capable among students by the gain in ethical or spiritual symmetry
and &aelig;sthetic or intellectual harmony. The ode or hymn&mdash;I need remind no
probable reader that the terms are synonymous in the speech of
Pindar&mdash;asserts its primacy or pre-eminence over other forms of poetry
in the very name which defines or proclaims it as essentially the song;
as something above all less pure and absolute kinds of song by the very
nature and law of its being. The Greek form, with its regular
arrangement of turn, return, and aftersong, is not to be imitated
because it is Greek, but to be adopted because it is best: the very
best, as a rule, that could be imagined for lyrical expression of the
thing conceived or lyrical aspiration towards the aim imagined. The
rhythmic reason of its rigid but not arbitrary law lies simply and
solely in the charm of its regular variations. This can be given in
English as clearly and fully, if not so sweetly and subtly, as in Greek;
and should, therefore, be expected and required in an English poem of
the same nature and proportion. The Sapphic or Alcaic ode, a simple
sequence of identical stanzas, could be imitated or revived in Latin by
translators or disciples: the scheme of it is exquisitely adequate and
sufficient for comparatively short flights of passion or emotion, ardent
or contemplative and personal or patriotic; but what can be done in
English could not be attempted in Latin. It seems strange to me, our
language being what it is, that our literature should be no richer than
it is in examples of the higher or at least the more capacious and
ambitious kind of ode. Not that the full Pindaric form of threefold or
triune structure need be or should be always adopted: but without an
accurately corresponsive or antiphonal scheme of music even the master
of masters, who is Coleridge, could not produce, even through the superb
and enchanting melodies of such a poem as his 'Dejection,' a fit and
complete companion, a full and perfect rival, to such a poem as his ode
on France.</p>

<p>The title of ode may more properly and fairly be so extended as to cover
all lyrical poems in stanzas or couplets than so strained as to include
a lawless lyric of such irregular and uneven build as Coleridge only and
hardly could make acceptable or admissible among more natural and lawful
forms of poetry. Law, not lawlessness, is the natural condition of
poetic life; but the law must itself be poetic and not pedantic, natural
and not conventional. It would be a trivial precision or restriction
which would refuse the title of ode to the stanzas of Milton or the
heptameters of Aristophanes; that glorious form of lyric verse which a
critic of our own day, as you may not impossibly remember, has likened
with such magnificent felicity of comparison to the gallop of the horses
of the sun. Nor, I presume, should this title be denied to a poem
written in the more modest metre&mdash;more modest as being shorter by a
foot&mdash;which was chosen for those twin poems of antiphonal correspondence
in subject and in sound, the 'Hymn to Proserpine' and the 'Hymn of Man':
the deathsong of spiritual decadence and the birthsong of spiritual
renascence. Perhaps, too, my first stanzas addressed to Victor Hugo may
be ranked as no less of an ode than that on the insurrection in Candia:
a poem which attracted, whether or not it may have deserved, the notice
and commendation of Mazzini: from whom I received, on the occasion of
its appearance, a letter which was the beginning of my personal
intercourse with the man whom I had always revered above all other men
on earth. But for this happy accident I might not feel disposed to set
much store by my first attempt at a regular ode of orthodox or
legitimate construction; I doubt whether it quite succeeded in evading
the criminal risk and the capital offence of formality; at least until
the change of note in the closing epode gave fuller scope and freer play
of wing to the musical expression. But in my later ode on Athens,
absolutely faithful as it is in form to the strictest type and the most
stringent law of Pindaric hymnology, I venture to believe that there is
no more sign of this infirmity than in the less classically regulated
poem on the Armada; which, though built on a new scheme, is nevertheless
in its way, I think, a legitimate ode, by right of its regularity in
general arrangement of corresponsive divisions. By the test of these two
poems I am content that my claims should be decided and my station
determined as a lyric poet in the higher sense of the term; a craftsman
in the most ambitious line of his art that ever aroused or ever can
arouse the emulous aspiration of his kind.</p>

<p>Even had I ever felt the same impulse to attempt and the same ambition
to achieve the enterprise of epic or narrative that I had always felt
with regard to lyric or dramatic work, I could never have proposed to
myself the lowly and unambitious aim of competition with the work of so
notable a contemporary workman in the humbler branch of that line as
William Morris. No conception could have been further from my mind when
I undertook to rehandle the deathless legend of Tristram than that of so
modest and preposterous a trial of rivalry. My aim was simply to present
that story, not diluted and debased as it had been in our own time by
other hands, but undefaced by improvement and undeformed by
transformation, as it was known to the age of Dante wherever the
chronicles of romance found hearing, from Ercildoune to Florence: and
not in the epic or romantic form of sustained or continuous narrative,
but mainly through a succession of dramatic scenes or pictures with
descriptive settings or backgrounds: the scenes being of the simplest
construction, duologue or monologue, without so much as the classically
permissible intervention of a third or fourth person. It is only in our
native northern form of narrative poetry, on the old and unrivalled
model of the English ballad, that I can claim to have done any work of
the kind worth reference: unless the story of Balen should be considered
as something other than a series or sequence of ballads. A more
plausible objection was brought to bear against 'Tristram of Lyonesse'
than that of failure in an enterprise which I never thought of
undertaking: the objection of an irreconcilable incongruity between the
incidents of the old legend and the meditations on man and nature, life
and death, chance and destiny, assigned to a typical hero of chivalrous
romance. And this objection might be unanswerable if the slightest
attempt had been made to treat the legend as in any possible sense
historical or capable of either rational or ideal association with
history, such as would assimilate the name and fame of Arthur to the
name and fame of any actual and indisputable Alfred or Albert of the
future. But the age when these romances actually lived and flourished
side by side with the reviving legends of Thebes and Troy, not in the
crude and bloodless forms of Celtic and archaic fancy but in the ampler
and manlier developments of Teutonic and medi&aelig;val imagination, was the
age of Dante and of Chaucer: an age in which men were only too prone to
waste their time on the twin sciences of astrology and theology, to
expend their energies in the jungle of pseudosophy or the morass of
metaphysics. There is surely nothing more incongruous or anachronic in
the soliloquy of Tristram after his separation from Iseult than in the
lecture of Theseus after the obsequies of Arcite. Both heroes belong to
the same impossible age of an imaginary world: and each has an equal
right, should it so please his chronicler, to reason in the pauses of
action and philosophise in the intervals of adventure. After all, the
active men of the actual age of chivalry were not all of them mere
muscular machines for martial or pacific exercise of their physical
functions or abilities.</p>

<p>You would agree, if the point were worth discussion, that it might
savour somewhat of pretention, if not of affectation, to be over
particular in arrangement of poems according to subject rather than
form, spirit rather than method, or motive rather than execution: and
yet there might be some excuse for the fancy or the pedantry of such a
classification as should set apart, for example, poems inspired by the
influence of places, whether seen but once or familiar for years or
associated with the earliest memories within cognisance or record of the
mind, and poems inspired by the emotions of regard or regret for the
living or the dead; above all, by the rare and profound passion of
reverence and love and faith which labours and rejoices to find
utterance in some tributary sacrifice of song. Mere descriptive poetry
of the prepense and formal kind is exceptionally if not proverbially
liable to incur and to deserve the charge of dullness: it is unnecessary
to emphasise or obtrude the personal note, the presence or the emotion
of a spectator, but it is necessary to make it felt and keep it
perceptible if the poem is to have life in it or even a right to live:
felt as in Wordsworth's work it is always, perceptible as it is always
in Shelley's. This note is more plain and positive than usual in the
poem which attempts&mdash;at once a simple and an ambitious attempt&mdash;to
render the contrast and the concord of night and day on Loch Torridon:
it is, I think, duly sensible though implicitly subdued in four poems of
the West Undercliff, born or begotten of sunset in the bay and moonlight
on the cliffs, noon or morning in a living and shining garden, afternoon
or twilight on one left flowerless and forsaken. Not to you or any other
poet, nor indeed to the very humblest and simplest lover of poetry, will
it seem incongruous or strange, suggestive of imperfect sympathy with
life or deficient inspiration from nature, that the very words of Sappho
should be heard and recognised in the notes of the nightingales, the
glory of the presence of dead poets imagined in the presence of the
glory of the sky, the lustre of their advent and their passage felt
visible as in vision on the live and limpid floorwork of the cloudless
and sunset-coloured sea. The half-brained creature to whom books are
other than living things may see with the eyes of a bat and draw with
the fingers of a mole his dullard's distinction between books and life:
those who live the fuller life of a higher animal than he know that
books are to poets as much part of that life as pictures are to painters
or as music is to musicians, dead matter though they may be to the
spiritually still-born children of dirt and dullness who find it
possible and natural to live while dead in heart and brain. Marlowe and
Shakespeare, &AElig;schylus and Sappho, do not for us live only on the dusty
shelves of libraries.</p>

<p>It is hardly probable that especial and familiar love of places should
give any special value to verses written under the influence of their
charm: no intimacy of years and no association with the past gave any
colour of emotion to many other studies of English land and sea which
certainly are no less faithful and possibly have no less spiritual or
poetic life in them than the four to which I have just referred, whose
localities lie all within the boundary of a mile or so. No contrast
could be stronger than that between the majestic and exquisite glory of
cliff and crag, lawn and woodland, garden and lea, to which I have done
homage though assuredly I have not done justice in these four poems&mdash;'In
the Bay,' 'On the Cliffs,' 'A Forsaken Garden,' the dedication of 'The
Sisters'&mdash;and the dreary beauty, inhuman if not unearthly in its
desolation, of the innumerable creeks and inlets, lined and paven with
sea-flowers, which make of the salt marshes a fit and funereal setting,
a fatal and appropriate foreground, for the supreme desolation of the
relics of Dunwich; the beautiful and awful solitude of a wilderness on
which the sea has forbidden man to build or live, overtopped and bounded
by the tragic and ghastly solitude of a headland on which the sea has
forbidden the works of human charity and piety to survive: between the
dense and sand-encumbered tides which are eating the desecrated wreck
and ruin of them all away, and the matchless magic, the ineffable
fascination of the sea whose beauties and delights, whose translucent
depths of water and divers-coloured banks of submarine foliage and
flowerage, but faintly reflected in the stanzas of the little ode 'Off
Shore,' complete the charm of the scenes as faintly sketched or shadowed
forth in the poems just named, or the sterner and stranger magic of the
seaboard to which tribute was paid in 'An Autumn Vision,' 'A Swimmer's
Dream,' 'On the South Coast,' 'Neap-tide': or, again, between the
sterile stretches and sad limitless outlook of the shore which faces a
hitherto undetermined and interminable sea, and the joyful and fateful
beauty of the seas off Bamborough and the seas about Sark and Guernsey.
But if there is enough of the human or personal note to bring into touch
the various poems which deal with these various impressions, there may
perhaps be no less of it discernible in such as try to render the effect
of inland or woodland solitude&mdash;the splendid oppression of nature at
noon which found utterance of old in words of such singular and
everlasting significance as panic and nympholepsy.</p>

<p>The retrospect across many years over the many eulogistic and elegiac
poems which I have inscribed or devoted to the commemoration or the
panegyric of the living or the dead has this in it of pride and
pleasure, that I find little to recant and nothing to repent on
reconsideration of them all. If ever a word of tributary thanksgiving
for the delight and the benefit of loyal admiration evoked in the spirit
of a boy or aroused in the intelligence of a man may seem to exceed the
limit of demonstrable accuracy, I have no apology to offer for any such
aberration from the safe path of tepid praise or conventional applause.
I can truly say with Shelley that I have been fortunate in friendships:
I might add if I cared, as he if he had cared might have added, that I
have been no less fortunate in my enemies than in my friends; and this,
though by comparison a matter of ineffable insignificance, can hardly be
to any rational and right-minded man a matter of positive indifference.
Rather should it be always a subject for thankfulness and
self-congratulation if a man can honestly and reasonably feel assured
that his friends and foes alike have been always and at almost all
points the very men he would have chosen, had choice and foresight been
allowed him, at the very outset of his career in life. I should never,
when a boy, have dared to dream that as a man I might possibly be
admitted to the personal acquaintance of the three living gods, I do not
say of my idolatry, for idolatry is a term inapplicable where the gods
are real and true, but of my whole-souled and single-hearted worship:
and yet, when writing of Landor, of Mazzini, and of Hugo, I write of men
who have honoured me with the assurance and the evidence of their
cordial and affectionate regard. However inadequate and unworthy may be
my tribute to their glory when living and their memory when dead, it is
that of one whose gratitude and devotion found unforgettable favour in
their sight. And I must be allowed to add that the redeeming quality of
entire and absolute sincerity may be claimed on behalf of every line I
have written in honour of friends, acquaintances, or strangers. My
tribute to Richard Burton was not more genuine in its expression than my
tribute to Christina Rossetti. Two noble human creatures more utterly
unlike each other it would be unspeakably impossible to conceive; but it
was as simply natural for one who honoured them both to do honest
homage, before and after they had left us, to the saintly and secluded
poetess as to the adventurous and unsaintly hero. Wherever anything is
worthy of honour and thanksgiving it is or it always should be as
natural if not as delightful to give thanks and do honour to a stranger
as to a friend, to a benefactor long since dead as to a benefactor still
alive. To the kindred spirits of Philip Sidney and Aurelio Saffi it was
almost as equal a pleasure to offer what tribute I could bring as if
Sidney also could have honoured me with his personal friendship. To
Tennyson and Browning it was no less fit that I should give honour than
that I should do homage to the memory of Bruno, the martyred friend of
Sidney. And I can hardly remember any task that I ever took more delight
in discharging than I felt in the inadequate and partial payment of a
lifelong debt to the marvellous and matchless succession of poets who
made the glory of our country incomparable for ever by the work they did
between the joyful date of the rout of the Armada and the woful date of
the outbreak of civil war.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb, as I need not remind you, wrote for antiquity: nor need
you be assured that when I write plays it is with a view to their being
acted at the Globe, the Red Bull, or the Black Friars. And whatever may
be the dramatic or other defects of 'Marino Faliero' or 'Locrine,' they
do certainly bear the same relation to previous plays or attempts at
plays on the same subjects as 'King Henry V.' to 'The Famous
Victories'&mdash;if not as 'King Lear,' a poem beyond comparison with all
other works of man except possibly 'Prometheus' and 'Othello,' to the
primitive and infantile scrawl or drivel of 'King Leir and his three
daughters.' The fifth act of 'Marino Faliero,' hopelessly impossible as
it is from the point of view of modern stagecraft, could hardly have
been found too untheatrical, too utterly given over to talk without
action, by the audiences which endured and applauded the magnificent
monotony of Chapman's eloquence&mdash;the fervent and inexhaustible
declamation which was offered and accepted as a substitute for study of
character and interest of action when his two finest plays, if plays
they can be called, found favour with an incredibly intelligent and an
inconceivably tolerant audience. The metrical or executive experiment
attempted and carried through in 'Locrine' would have been improper to
any but a purely and wholly romantic play or poem: I do not think that
the life of human character or the lifelikeness of dramatic dialogue has
suffered from the bondage of rhyme or has been sacrificed to the
exigence of metre. The tragedy of 'The Sisters,' however defective it
may be in theatrical interest or progressive action, is the only modern
English play I know in which realism in the reproduction of natural
dialogue and accuracy in the representation of natural intercourse
between men and women of gentle birth and breeding have been found or
made compatible with expression in genuine if simple blank verse. It is
not for me to decide whether anything in the figures which play their
parts on my imaginary though realistic stage may be worthy of sympathy,
attention, or interest: but I think they talk and act as they would have
done in life without ever lapsing into platitude or breaking out of
nature.</p>

<p>In 'Rosamund, Queen of the Lombards,' I took up a subject long since
mishandled by an English dramatist of all but the highest rank, and one
which in later days Alfieri had commemorated in a magnificent passage of
a wholly unhistoric and somewhat unsatisfactory play. The comparatively
slight deviation from historic records in the final catastrophe or
consummation of mine is not, I think, to say the least, injurious to the
tragic effect or the moral interest of the story.</p>

<p>A writer conscious of any natural command over the musical resources of
his language can hardly fail to take such pleasure in the enjoyment of
this gift or instinct as the greatest writer and the greatest versifier
of our age must have felt at its highest possible degree when composing
a musical exercise of such incomparable scope and fullness as 'Les
Djinns.' But if he be a poet after the order of Hugo or Coleridge or
Shelley, the result will be something very much more than a musical
exercise; though indeed, except to such ears as should always be kept
closed against poetry, there is no music in verse which has not in it
sufficient fullness and ripeness of meaning, sufficient adequacy of
emotion or of thought, to abide the analysis of any other than the
purblind scrutiny of prepossession or the squint-eyed inspection of
malignity. There may perhaps be somewhat more depth and variety of
feeling or reflection condensed into the narrow frame of the poems which
compose 'A Century of Roundels' than would be needed to fulfil the epic
vacuity of a Ch&#339;rilus or a Coluthus. And the form chosen for my only
narrative poem was chosen as a test of the truth of my conviction that
such work could be done better on the straitest and the strictest
principles of verse than on the looser and more slippery lines of
medi&aelig;val or modern improvisation. The impulsive and irregular verse
which had been held sufficient for the stanza selected or accepted by
Thornton and by Tennyson seemed capable of improvement and invigoration
as a vehicle or a medium for poetic narrative. And I think it has not
been found unfit to give something of dignity as well as facility to a
narrative which recasts in modern English verse one of the noblest and
loveliest old English legends. There is no episode in the cycle of
Arthurian romance more genuinely Homeric in its sublime simplicity and
its pathetic sublimity of submission to the masterdom of fate than that
which I have rather reproduced than recast in 'The Tale of Balen': and
impossible as it is to render the text or express the spirit of the
Iliad in English prose or rhyme&mdash;above all, in English blank verse&mdash;it
is possible, in such a metre as was chosen and refashioned for this
poem, to give some sense of the rage and rapture of battle for which
Homer himself could only find fit and full expression by similitudes
drawn like mine from the revels and the terrors and the glories of the
sea.</p>

<p>It is nothing to me that what I write should find immediate or general
acceptance: it is much to know that on the whole it has won for me the
right to address this dedication and inscribe this edition to you.</p>

<span class="i0">I found in dreams a place of wind and flowers,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A lady clothed like summer with sweet hours.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her beauty, fervent as a fiery moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Made my blood burn and swoon<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a flame rained upon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow had filled her shaken eyelids' blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her mouth's sad red heavy rose all through<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She held a little cithern by the strings,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shaped heartwise, strung with subtle-coloured hair<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of some dead lute-player<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in dead years had done delicious things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seven strings were named accordingly;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The first string charity,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The second tenderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest were pleasure, sorrow, sleep, and sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loving-kindness, that is pity's kin<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So rode I, hearing all these chant and pray,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And marvelled; till before us rose and fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White cursed hills, like outer skirts of hell<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like a jagged shell's lips, harsh, untunable,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Blown in between by devils' wrangling breath;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Even unto Rome where God's grace tarrieth.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And so the sweet-souled father gave him ease.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yea, and the severed half thereof I leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pittheus, because he slew not (when that face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was tender, and the life still soft in it)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The small swathed child, but bred him for my fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would I had been the first that took her death<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Let us go hence, my songs; she will not hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us go hence together without fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep silence now, for singing-time is over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over all old things and all things dear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She loves not you nor me as all we love her.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There is no help, for all these things are so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the world is bitter as a tear.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Let us go home and hence; she will not weep.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Flowers without scent, and fruits that would not grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying 'If thou wilt, thrust in thy sickle and reap.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All is reaped now; no grass is left to mow;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Come hence, let be, lie still; it is enough.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love is a barren sea, bitter and deep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though she saw all heaven in flower above,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She would not love.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let us give up, go down; she will not care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though all the stars made gold of all the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sea moving saw before it move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One moon-flower making all the foam-flowers fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though all those waves went over us, and drove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She would not care.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let us go hence, go hence; she will not see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing all once more together; surely she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She too, remembering days and words that were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will turn a little toward us, sighing; but we,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are hence, we are gone, as though we had not been there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, and though all men seeing had pity on me,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She would not see.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Intense device, and superflux of pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vex thee with amorous agonies, and shake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life at thy lips, and leave it there to ache;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Intolerable interludes, and infinite ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Relapse and reluctation of the breath,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That shuddering lips make moist with waterish wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eyes the bluer for all those hidden hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pleasure fills with tears and feeds from flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce at the heart with fire that half comes through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all the flowerlike white stained round with blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fervent underlid, and that above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted with laughter or abashed with love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine amorous girdle, full of thee and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leavings of the lilies in thine hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, all sweet words of thine and all thy ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the fruit of nights and flower of days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stinging lips wherein the hot sweet brine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Love was born of burns and foams like wine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yea, all thy beauty sickens me with love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy girdle empty of thee and now not fair,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sweet soul, sweet mouth of all that laughs and lives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine is she, very mine; and she forgives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I beheld in sleep the light that is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her high place in Paphos, heard the kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of body and soul that mix with eager tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughter stinging through the eyes and ears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw Love, as burning flame from crown to feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imperishable, upon her storied seat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear eyelids lifted toward the north and south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mind of many colours, and a mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of many tunes and kisses; and she bowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all her subtle face laughing aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bowed down upon me, saying, "Who doth thee wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sappho?" but thou&mdash;thy body is the song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy mouth the music; thou art more than I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though my voice die not till the whole world die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though men that hear it madden; though love weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though nature change, though shame be charmed to sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, wilt thou slay me lest I kiss thee dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the queen laughed from her sweet heart and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Even she that flies shall follow for thy sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she shall give thee gifts that would not take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall kiss that would not kiss thee" (yea, kiss me)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"When thou wouldst not"&mdash;when I would not kiss thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, more to me than all men as thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not my songs assuage her at the heart?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, sweet to me as life seems sweet to death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should her wrath fill thee with fearful breath?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, sweet, for is she God alone? hath she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made earth and all the centuries of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taught the sun ways to travel, woven most fine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moonbeams, shed the starbeams forth as wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound with her myrtles, beaten with her rods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young men and the maidens and the gods?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have we not lips to love with, eyes for tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And summer and flower of women and of years?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stars for the foot of morning, and for noon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sunlight, and exaltation of the moon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waters that answer waters, fields that wear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lilies, and languor of the Lesbian air?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond those flying feet of fluttered doves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are there not other gods for other loves?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, though she scourge thee, sweetest, for my sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blossom not thorns and flowers not blood should break.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah that my lips were tuneless lips, but pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the bruised blossom of thy scourged white breast!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah that my mouth for Muses' milk were fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the sweet blood thy sweet small wounds had bled!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with my tongue I felt them, and could taste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faint flakes from thy bosom to the waist!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I could drink thy veins as wine, and eat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy breasts like honey! that from face to feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy body were abolished and consumed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my flesh thy very flesh entombed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, ah, thy beauty! like a beast it bites,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stings like an adder, like an arrow smites.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah sweet, and sweet again, and seven times sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The paces and the pauses of thy feet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah sweeter than all sleep or summer air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fallen fillets fragrant from thine hair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, though their alien kisses do me wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeter thy lips than mine with all their song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy shoulders whiter than a fleece of white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flower-sweet fingers, good to bruise or bite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As honeycomb of the inmost honey-cells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With almond-shaped and roseleaf-coloured shells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blood like purple blossom at the tips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quivering; and pain made perfect in thy lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my sake when I hurt thee; O that I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Durst crush thee out of life with love, and die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Die of thy pain and my delight, and be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with thy blood and molten into thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would I not plague thee dying overmuch?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would I not hurt thee perfectly? not touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy pores of sense with torture, and make bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine eyes with bloodlike tears and grievous light?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strike pang from pang as note is struck from note,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catch the sob's middle music in thy throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take thy limbs living, and new-mould with these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lyre of many faultless agonies?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feed thee with fever and famine and fine drouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With perfect pangs convulse thy perfect mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make thy life shudder in thee and burn afresh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wring thy very spirit through the flesh?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cruel? but love makes all that love him well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As wise as heaven and crueller than hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me hath love made more bitter toward thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than death toward man; but were I made as he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath made all things to break them one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If my feet trod upon the stars and sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And souls of men as his have alway trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God knows I might be crueller than God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who shall change with prayers or thanksgivings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystery of the cruelty of things?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or say what God above all gods and years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With offering and blood-sacrifice of tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lamentation from strange lands, from graves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the snake pastures, from scarred mouths of slaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From prison, and from plunging prows of ships<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through flamelike foam of the sea's closing lips&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thwartings of strange signs, and wind-blown hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of comets, desolating the dim air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When darkness is made fast with seals and bars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fierce reluctance of disastrous stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eclipse, and sound of shaken hills, and wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkening, and blind inexpiable things&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sorrow of labouring moons, and altering light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And travail of the planets of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weeping of the weary Pleiads seven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeds the mute melancholy lust of heaven?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not his incense bitterness, his meat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murder? his hidden face and iron feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath not man known, and felt them on their way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threaten and trample all things and every day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath he not sent us hunger? who hath cursed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spirit and flesh with longing? filled with thirst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their lips who cried unto him? who bade exceed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fervid will, fall short the feeble deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bade sink the spirit and the flesh aspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pain animate the dust of dead desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And life yield up her flower to violent fate?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him would I reach, him smite, him desecrate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierce the cold lips of God with human breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mix his immortality with death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why hath he made us? what had all we done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we should live and loathe the sterile sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the moon wax paler as she wanes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pulse by pulse feel time grow through our veins?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee too the years shall cover; thou shalt be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the rose born of one same blood with thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a song sung, as a word said, and fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flower-wise, and be not any more at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor any memory of thee anywhere;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For never Muse has bound above thine hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The high Pierian flower whose graft outgrows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All summer kinship of the mortal rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And colour of deciduous days, nor shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reflex and flush of heaven about thine head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor reddened brows made pale by floral grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With splendid shadow from that lordlier leaf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, thou shalt be forgotten like spilt wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except these kisses of my lips on thine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brand them with immortality; but me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men shall not see bright fire nor hear the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor mix their hearts with music, nor behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast forth of heaven, with feet of awful gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plumeless wings that make the bright air blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lightning, with thunder for a hound behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunting through fields unfurrowed and unsown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the light and laughter, in the moan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And music, and in grasp of lip and hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shudder of water that makes felt on land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The immeasurable tremor of all the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memories shall mix and metaphors of me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like me shall be the shuddering calm of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all the winds of the world for pure delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close lips that quiver and fold up wings that ache;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When nightingales are louder for love's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaves tremble like lute-strings or like fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like me the one star swooning with desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even at the cold lips of the sleepless moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I at thine; like me the waste white noon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burnt through with barren sunlight; and like me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The land-stream and the tide-stream in the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am sick with time as these with ebb and flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the yearning in my veins I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yearning sound of waters; and mine eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burn as that beamless fire which fills the skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With troubled stars and travailing things of flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my heart the grief consuming them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Labours, and in my veins the thirst of these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the summer travail of the trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the winter sickness; and the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled full with deadly works of death and birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sore spent with hungry lusts of birth and death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has pain like mine in her divided breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her spring of leaves is barren, and her fruit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ashes; her boughs are burdened, and her root<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fibrous and gnarled with poison; underneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serpents have gnawn it through with tortuous teeth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made sharp upon the bones of all the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wild birds rend her branches overhead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, woven as raiment for his word and thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These hath God made, and me as these, and wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Song, and hath lit it at my lips; and me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth shall not gather though she feed on thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a shed tear shalt thou be shed; but I&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, earth may labour, men live long and die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Years change and stars, and the high God devise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New things, and old things wane before his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who wields and wrecks them, being more strong than they&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, having made me, me he shall not slay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor slay nor satiate, like those herds of his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who laugh and live a little, and their kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contents them, and their loves are swift and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sure death grasps and gains them with slow feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love they or hate they, strive or bow their knees&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all these end; he hath his will of these.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, but albeit he slay me, hating me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Albeit he hide me in the deep dear sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cover me with cool wan foam, and ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This soul of mine as any soul of these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give me water and great sweet waves, and make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very sea's name lordlier for my sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole sea sweeter&mdash;albeit I die indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hide myself and sleep and no man heed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of me the high God hath not all his will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blossom of branches, and on each high hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear air and wind, and under in clamorous vales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce noises of the fiery nightingales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buds burning in the sudden spring like fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wan washed sand and the waves' vain desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sails seen like blown white flowers at sea, and words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bring tears swiftest, and long notes of birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Violently singing till the whole world sings&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I Sappho shall be one with all these things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all high things for ever; and my face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen once, my songs once heard in a strange place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleave to men's lives, and waste the days thereof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gladness and much sadness and long love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, they shall say, earth's womb has borne in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New things, and never this best thing again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne days and men, borne fruits and wars and wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seasons and songs, but no song more like mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they shall know me as ye who have known me here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last year when I loved Atthis, and this year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I love thee; and they shall praise me, and say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"She hath all time as all we have our day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall she not live and have her will"&mdash;even I?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, though thou diest, I say I shall not die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For these shall give me of their souls, shall give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life, and the days and loves wherewith I live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall quicken me with loving, fill with breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save me and serve me, strive for me with death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, that neither moon nor snow nor dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor all cold things can purge me wholly through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assuage me nor allay me nor appease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till supreme sleep shall bring me bloodless ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till time wax faint in all his periods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till fate undo the bondage of the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay, to slake and satiate me all through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lotus and Lethe on my lips like dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shed around and over and under me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick darkness and the insuperable sea.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have lived long enough, having seen one thing, that love hath an end;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art more than the day or the morrow, the seasons that laugh or that weep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For these give joy and sorrow; but thou, Proserpina, sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet is the treading of wine, and sweet the feet of the dove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a goodlier gift is thine than foam of the grapes or love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, is not even Apollo, with hair and harpstring of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bitter God to follow, a beautiful God to behold?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am sick of singing: the bays burn deep and chafe: I am fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Gods we know not of, who give us our daily breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know they are cruel as love or life, and lovely as death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Gods dethroned and deceased, cast forth, wiped out in a day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From your wrath is the world released, redeemed from your chains, men say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New Gods are crowned in the city; their flowers have broken your rods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are merciful, clothed with pity, the young compassionate Gods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for me their new device is barren, the days are bare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things long past over suffice, and men forgotten that were.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time and the Gods are at strife; ye dwell in the midst thereof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draining a little life from the barren breasts of love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say to you, cease, take rest; yea, I say to you all, be at peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall cease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou yet take all, Galilean? but these thou shalt not take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laurel, the palms and the p&aelig;an, the breasts of the nymphs in the brake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breasts more soft than a dove's, that tremble with tenderer breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the wings of the Loves, and all the joy before death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dropped and deep in the flowers, with strings that flicker like fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than these wilt thou give, things fairer than all these things?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, for a little we live, and life hath mutable wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little while and we die; shall life not thrive as it may?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For no man under the sky lives twice, outliving his day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grief is a grievous thing, and a man hath enough of his tears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should he labour, and bring fresh grief to blacken his years?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laurel is green for a season, and love is sweet for a day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But love grows bitter with treason, and laurel outlives not May.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep, shall we sleep after all? for the world is not sweet in the end;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the old faiths loosen and fall, the new years ruin and rend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fate is a sea without shore, and the soul is a rock that abides;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam of the tides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O lips that the live blood faints in, the leavings of racks and rods!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though all men abase them before you in spirit, and all knees bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I kneel not neither adore you, but standing, look to the end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All delicate days and pleasant, all spirits and sorrows are cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of the past:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where beyond the extreme sea-wall, and between the remote sea-gates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waste water washes, and tall ships founder, and deep death waits:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, mighty with deepening sides, clad about with the seas as with wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And impelled of invisible tides, and fulfilled of unspeakable things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White-eyed and poisonous-finned, shark-toothed and serpentine-curled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolls, under the whitening wind of the future, the wave of the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The depths stand naked in sunder behind it, the storms flee away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In its sides is the north-wind bound; and its salt is of all men's tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With light of ruin, and sound of changes, and pulse of years:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With travail of day after day, and with trouble of hour upon hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bitter as blood is the spray; and the crests are as fangs that devour:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits to be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its noise as the noise in a dream; and its depth as the roots of the sea:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of the air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble, and time is made bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will ye bridle the deep sea with reins, will ye chasten the high sea with rods?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will ye take her to chain her with chains, who is older than all ye Gods?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ye as a wind shall go by, as a fire shall ye pass and be past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye are Gods, and behold, ye shall die, and the waves be upon you at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the darkness of time, in the deeps of the years, in the changes of things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget you for kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and our forefathers trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though these that were Gods are dead, and thou being dead art a God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though before thee the throned Cytherean be fallen, and hidden her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thy kingdom shall pass, Galilean, thy dead shall go down to thee dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art throned where another was king; where another was queen she is crowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, once we had sight of another: but now she is queen, say these.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not as thine, not as thine was our mother, a blossom of flowering seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed round with the world's desire as with raiment, and fair as the foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fleeter than kindled fire, and a goddess, and mother of Rome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thine came pale and a maiden, and sister to sorrow; but ours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White rose of the rose-white water, a silver splendour, a flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bent down unto us that besought her, and earth grew sweet with her name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thine came weeping, a slave among slaves, and rejected; but she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her foot on the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wonderful waters knew her, the winds and the viewless ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of the bays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye are fallen, our lords, by what token? we wist that ye should not fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye were all so fair that are broken; and one more fair than ye all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I turn to her still, having seen she shall surely abide in the end;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O daughter of earth, of my mother, her crown and blossom of birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am also, I also, thy brother; I go as I came unto earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven, the night where thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the silence is more than all tunes, where sleep overflows from the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world, and the red rose is white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the murmur of spirits that sleep in the shadow of Gods from afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the sweet low light of thy face, under heavens untrod by the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my soul with their souls find place, and forget what is done and undone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art more than the Gods who number the days of our temporal breath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For these give labour and slumber; but thou, Proserpina, death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore now at thy feet I abide for a season in silence. I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall die as my fathers died, and sleep as they sleep; even so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a span;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is man.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So long I endure, no longer; and laugh not again, neither weep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there is no God found stronger than death; and death is a sleep.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Out of the golden remote wild west where the sea without shore is,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Full of the sunset, and sad, if at all, with the fulness of joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a wind sets in with the autumn that blows from the region of stories,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Blows with a perfume of songs and of memories beloved from a boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blows from the capes of the past oversea to the bays of the present,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Filled as with shadow of sound with the pulse of invisible feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far out to the shallows and straits of the future, by rough ways or pleasant,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is it thither the wind's wings beat? is it hither to me, O my sweet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thee, in the stream of the deep tide-wind blowing in with the water,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thee I behold as a bird borne in with the wind from the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight from the sunset, across white waves whence rose as a daughter<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Venus thy mother, in years when the world was a water at rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the distance of dreams, as a dream that abides after slumber,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Strayed from the fugitive flock of the night, when the moon overhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wanes in the wan waste heights of the heaven, and stars without number<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Die without sound, and are spent like lamps that are burnt by the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes back to me, stays by me, lulls me with touch of forgotten caresses,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">One warm dream clad about with a fire as of life that endures;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The delight of thy face, and the sound of thy feet, and the wind of thy tresses,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all of a man that regrets, and all of a maid that allures.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thy bosom is warm for my face and profound as a manifold flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy silence as music, thy voice as an odour that fades in a flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a dream, not a dream is the kiss of thy mouth, and the bountiful hour<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That makes me forget what was sin, and would make me forget were it shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine eyes that are quiet, thine hands that are tender, thy lips that are loving,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Comfort and cool me as dew in the dawn of a moon like a dream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my heart yearns baffled and blind, moved vainly toward thee, and moving<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As the refluent seaweed moves in the languid exuberant stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair as a rose is on earth, as a rose under water in prison,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That stretches and swings to the slow passionate pulse of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closed up from the air and the sun, but alive, as a ghost rearisen,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pale as the love that revives as a ghost rearisen in me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the bountiful infinite west, from the happy memorial places<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Full of the stately repose and the lordly delight of the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the fortunate islands are lit with the light of ineffable faces,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the sound of a sea without wind is about them, and sunset is red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come back to redeem and release me from love that recalls and represses,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That cleaves to my flesh as a flame, till the serpent has eaten his fill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the bitter delights of the dark, and the feverish, the furtive caresses<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That murder the youth in a man or ever his heart have its will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy lips cannot laugh and thine eyes cannot weep; thou art pale as a rose is,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Paler and sweeter than leaves that cover the blush of the bud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heart of the flower is compassion, and pity the core it encloses,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pity, not love, that is born of the breath and decays with the blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the cross that a wild nun clasps till the edge of it bruises her bosom,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So love wounds as we grasp it, and blackens and burns as a flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have loved overmuch in my life; when the live bud bursts with the blossom,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bitter as ashes or tears is the fruit, and the wine thereof shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a heart that its anguish divides is the green bud cloven asunder;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As the blood of a man self-slain is the flush of the leaves that allure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the perfume as poison and wine to the brain, a delight and a wonder;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the thorns are too sharp for a boy, too slight for a man, to endure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too soon did I love it, and lost love's rose; and I cared not for glory's:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Only the blossoms of sleep and of pleasure were mixed in my hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it myrtle or poppy thy garland was woven with, O my Dolores?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Was it pallor of slumber, or blush as of blood, that I found in thee fair?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For desire is a respite from love, and the flesh not the heart is her fuel;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She was sweet to me once, who am fled and escaped from the rage of her reign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who behold as of old time at hand as I turn, with her mouth growing cruel,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And flushed as with wine with the blood of her lovers, Our Lady of Pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low down where the thicket is thicker with thorns than with leaves in the summer,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the brake is a gleaming of eyes and a hissing of tongues that I knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lithe long throats of her snakes reach round her, their mouths overcome her,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And her lips grow cool with their foam, made moist as a desert with dew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the thirst and the hunger of lust though her beautiful lips be so bitter,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With the cold foul foam of the snakes they soften and redden and smile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her fierce mouth sweetens, her eyes wax wide and her eyelashes glitter,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And she laughs with a savour of blood in her face, and a savour of guile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She laughs, and her hands reach hither, her hair blows hither and hisses,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As a low-lit flame in a wind, back-blown till it shudder and leap;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let her lips not again lay hold on my soul, nor her poisonous kisses,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To consume it alive and divide from thy bosom, Our Lady of Sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah daughter of sunset and slumber, if now it return into prison,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who shall redeem it anew? but we, if thou wilt, let us fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us take to us, now that the white skies thrill with a moon unarisen,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Swift horses of fear or of love, take flight and depart and not die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are swifter than dreams, they are stronger than death; there is none that hath ridden,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">None that shall ride in the dim strange ways of his life as we ride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the meadows of memory, the highlands of hope, and the shore that is hidden,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where life breaks loud and unseen, a sonorous invisible tide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the sands where sorrow has trodden, the salt pools bitter and sterile,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By the thundering reef and the low sea-wall and the channel of years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our wild steeds press on the night, strain hard through pleasure and peril,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Shrill shrieks in our faces the blind bland air that was mute as a maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Stung into storm by the speed of our passage, and deaf where we past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our spirits too burn as we bound, thine holy but mine heavy-laden,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As we burn with the fire of our flight; ah love, shall we win at the last?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stooped with loose gurgle of waters incoming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found me an old sick woman, lamed and lean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside a growth of builded olive-boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence multiplied thick song of thick-plumed throats&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also wet tears filled up my hollow hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By reason of my crying into them&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pitied me; for as cold water ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And washed the pitchers full from lip to lip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So washed both eyes full the strong salt of tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ye put water to my mouth, made sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With brown hill-berries; so in time I spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gathered my loose knees from under me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moreover in the broad fair halls this month<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have I found space and bountiful abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please me. I Demeter speak of this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who am the mother and the mate of things:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as ill men by drugs or singing words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut the doors inward of the narrowed womb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a lock bolted with round iron through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus I shut up the body and sweet mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all soft pasture and the tender land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that no seed can enter in by it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though one sow thickly, nor some grain get out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past the hard clods men cleave and bite with steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To widen the sealed lips of them for use.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None of you is there in the peopled street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But knows how all the dry-drawn furrows ache<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With no green spot made count of in the black:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the wind finds no comfortable grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is assuaged with bud nor breath of herbs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in hot autumn when ye house the stacks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All fields are helpless in the sun, all trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand as a man stripped out of all but skin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nevertheless ye sick have help to get<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By means and stablished ordinance of God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For God is wiser than a good man is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never shall new grass be sweet in earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I get righted of my wound and wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By changing counsel of ill-minded Zeus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For of all other gods is none save me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed with like power to build and break the year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I make the lesser green begin, when spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touches not earth but with one fearful foot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as a careful gilder with grave art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soberly colours and completes the face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mouth, chin and all, of some sweet work in stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I carve the shapes of grass and tender corn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And colour the ripe edges and long spikes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the red increase and the grace of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tradesman in soft wools is cunninger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kill the secret of the fat white fleece<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With stains of blue and purple wrought in it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three moons were made and three moons burnt away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I held journey hither out of Crete<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comfortless, tended by grave Hecate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom my wound stung with double iron point;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all my face was like a cloth wrung out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With close and weeping wrinkles, and both lids<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sodden with salt continuance of tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Hades and the sidelong will of Zeus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that lame wisdom that has writhen feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cunning, begotten in the bed of Shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These three took evil will at me, and made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such counsel that when time got wing to fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Hades out of summer and low fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forced the bright body of Persephone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of pure grass, where she lying down, red flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made their sharp little shadows on her sides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale heat, pale colour on pale maiden flesh&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chill water slid over her reddening feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Killing the throbs in their soft blood; and birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perched next her elbow and pecking at her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched their necks more to see her than even to sing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sharp thing is it I have need to say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Hades holding both white wrists of hers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unloosed the girdle and with knot by knot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound her between his wheels upon the seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound her pure body, holiest yet and dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me and God as always, clothed about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blossoms loosened as her knees went down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let fall as she let go of this and this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By tens and twenties, tumbled to her feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White waifs or purple of the pasturage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore with only going up and down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My feet were wasted, and the gracious air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me discomfortable and dun, became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As weak smoke blowing in the under world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And finding in the process of ill days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What part had Zeus herein, and how as mate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He coped with Hades, yokefellow in sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I set my lips against the meat of gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drank not neither ate or slept in heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor in the golden greeting of their mouths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did ear take note of me, nor eye at all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Track my feet going in the ways of them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a great fire on some strait slip of land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between two washing inlets of wet sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That burns the grass up to each lip of beach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strengthens, waxing in the growth of wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So burnt my soul in me at heaven and earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each way a ruin and a hungry plague,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Visible evil; nor could any night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put cool between mine eyelids, nor the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With competence of gold fill out my want.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea so my flame burnt up the grass and stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone to the salt-white edges of thin sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distempered all the gracious work, and made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sick change, unseasonable increase of days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scant avail of seasons; for by this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair gods faint in hollow heaven: there comes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No taste of burnings of the twofold fat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave their palates smooth, nor in their lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft rings of smoke and weak scent wandering;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All cattle waste and rot, and their ill smell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grows alway from the lank unsavoury flesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no man slays for offering; the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waters moved beneath the heath and corn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preserve the people of fin-twinkling fish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And river-flies feed thick upon the smooth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all earth over is no man or bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Except the sweet race of the kingfisher)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lacks not and is wearied with much loss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the purple inward of the house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was softened with all grace of scent and sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ear and nostril perfecting my praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint grape-flowers and cloven honey-cake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the just grain with dues of the shed salt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made me content: yet my hand loosened not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its gripe upon your harvest all year long.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I, thus woman-muffled in wan flesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waste externals of a perished face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preserved the levels of my wrath and love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patiently ruled; and with soft offices<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cooled the sharp noons and busied the warm nights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In care of this my choice, this child my choice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triptolemus, the king's selected son:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this fair yearlong body, which hath grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong with strange milk upon the mortal lip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nerved with half a god, might so increase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outside the bulk and the bare scope of man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waxen over large to hold within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Base breath of yours and this impoverished air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I might exalt him past the flame of stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The limit and walled reach of the great world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore my breast made common to his mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal savours, and the taste whereat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice their hard life strains out the coloured veins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twice its brain confirms the narrow shell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also at night, unwinding cloth from cloth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As who unhusks an almond to the white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pastures curiously the purer taste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bared the gracious limbs and the soft feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unswaddled the weak hands, and in mid ash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid the sweet flesh of either feeble side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More tender for impressure of some touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than wax to any pen; and lit around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire, and made crawl the white worm-shapen flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leap in little angers spark by spark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At head at once and feet; and the faint hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hissed with rare sprinkles in the closer curl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like scaled oarage of a keen thin fish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sea-water, so in pure fire his feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck out, and the flame bit not in his flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But like a kiss it curled his lip, and heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fluttered his eyelids; so each night I blew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hot ash red to purge him to full god.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill is it when fear hungers in the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For painful food, and chokes thereon, being fed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ill slant eyes interpret the straight sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in their scope its white is wried to black:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the queen Metaneira mean I this;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For with sick wrath upon her lips, and heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Narrowing with fear the spleenful passages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thought to thread this web's fine ravel out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor leave her shuttle split in combing it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore she stole on us, and with hard sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peered, and stooped close; then with pale open mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the fire smote her in the eyes between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried, and the child's laugh, sharply shortening<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fire doth under rain, fell off; the flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writhed once all through and died, and in thick dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears fell from mine on the child's weeping eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyes dispossessed of strong inheritance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mortal fallen anew. Who not the less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From bud of beard to pale-grey flower of hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall wax vinewise to a lordly vine, whose grapes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bleed the red heavy blood of swoln soft wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subtle with sharp leaves' intricacy, until<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of white years and blossom of hoary days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I take him perfected; for whose one sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am thus gracious to the least who stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filleted with white wool and girt upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he whose prayer endures upon the lip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And falls not waste: wherefore let sacrifice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burn and run red in all the wider ways;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing I have sworn by the pale temples' band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poppied hair of gold Persephone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad-tressed and pleached low down about her brows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the sorrow in her lips, and death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her dumb and mournful-mouth&egrave;d minister,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My word for you is eased of its harsh weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doubled with soft promise; and your king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triptolemus, this Celeus dead and swathed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purple and pale for golden burial,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be your helper in my services,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dividing earth and reaping fruits thereof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fields where wait, well-girt, well-wreathen, all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavy-handed seasons all year through;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saving the choice of warm spear-headed grain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stooping sharp to the slant-sided share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All beasts that furrow the remeasured land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their bowed necks of burden equable.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It hath been seen and yet it shall be seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That out of tender mouths God's praise hath been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made perfect, and with wood and simple string<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hath played music sweet as shawm-playing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please himself with softness of all sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no small thing but hath been sometime found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full sweet of use, and no such humbleness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But God hath bruised withal the sentences<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And evidence of wise men witnessing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No leaf that is so soft a hidden thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It never shall get sight of the great sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strength of ten has been the strength of one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lowliness has waxed imperious.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There was in Rome a man Theophilus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of right great blood and gracious ways, that had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All noble fashions to make people glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a soft life of pleasurable days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a goodly man for one to praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flawless and whole upward from foot to head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His arms were a red hawk that alway fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a small bird with feathers gnawed upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beaten and plucked about the bosom-bone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereby a small round fleck like fire there was:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They called it in their tongue lampadias;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the banner of the lordly man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In many straits of sea and reaches wan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of quick wind, and many a shaken firth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It had seen fighting days of either earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Westward or east of waters Gaditane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(This was the place of sea-rocks under Spain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called after the great praise of Hercules)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And north beyond the washing Pontic seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far windy Russian places fabulous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And salt fierce tides of storm-swoln Bosphorus.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now as this lord came straying in Rome town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw a little lattice open down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after it a press of maidens' heads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sat upon their cold small quiet beds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talking, and played upon short-string&egrave;d lutes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other some ground perfume out of roots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathered by marvellous moons in Asia;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saffron and aloes and wild cassia,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coloured all through and smelling of the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over all these was a certain one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed softly, with sweet herbs about her hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bosom flowerful; her face more fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than sudden-singing April in soft lands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyed like a gracious bird, and in both hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She held a psalter painted green and red.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This Theophile laughed at the heart, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now God so help me hither and St. Paul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As by the new time of their festival<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have good will to take this maid to wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And herewith fell to fancies of her life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soft half-thoughts that ended suddenly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is man's guise to please himself, when he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not see one thing of his pleasant things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor with outwatch of many travailings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come to be eased of the least pain he hath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all his love and all his foolish wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the heavy manner of his mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus is he like a fisher fallen blind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That casts his nets across the boat awry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strike the sea, but lo, he striketh dry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plucks them back all broken for his pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bites his beard and casts across again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reaching wrong slips over in the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hath this man a strangled neck for fee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all his cost he chuckles in his throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This Theophile that little hereof wote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid wait to hear of her what she might be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men told him she had name of Dorothy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was a lady of a worthy house.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat this knight grew inly glorious<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he should have a love so fair of place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was a maiden of most quiet face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tender of speech, and had no hardihood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But was nigh feeble of her fearful blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mercy in her was so marvellous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her least years, that seeing her school-fellows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That read beside her stricken with a rod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would cry sore and say some word to God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he would ease her fellow of his pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no touch of sun or fallen rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever fell on a more gracious thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In middle Rome there was in stone-working<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The church of Venus painted royally.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chapels of it were some two or three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In each of them her tabernacle was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a wide window of six feet in glass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coloured with all her works in red and gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The altars had bright cloths and cups to hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wine of Venus for the services,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made out of honey and crushed wood-berries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shed sweet yellow through the thick wet red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on high days was borne upon the head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Venus' priest for any man to drink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that in drinking he should fall to think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On some fair face, and in the thought thereof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worship, and such should triumph in his love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this soft wine that did such grace and good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was new trans-shaped and mixed with Love's own blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in the fighting Trojan time was bled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For which came such a woe to Diomed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he was stifled after in hard sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some said that this wine-shedding should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made of the falling of Adonis' blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That curled upon the thorns and broken wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round the gold silk shoes on Venus' feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The taste thereof was as hot honey sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the mouth ran soft and riotous.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the holiness of Venus' house.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It was their worship, that in August days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve maidens should go through those Roman ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naked, and having gold across their brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their hair twisted in short golden rows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To minister to Venus in this wise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twelve men chosen in their companies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To match these maidens by the altar-stair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in one habit, crowned upon the hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among these men was chosen Theophile.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This knight went out and prayed a little while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding queen Venus by her hands and knees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will give thee twelve royal images<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut in glad gold, with marvels of wrought stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thy sweet priests to lean and pray upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jasper and hyacinth and chrysopras,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the strange Asian thalamite that was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hidden twelve ages under heavy sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the little sleepy pearls, to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shrine lit over with soft candle-flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning all night red as hot brows of shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thou wilt be my lady without sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goddess that art all gold outside and in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help me to serve thee in thy holy way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou knowest, Love, that in my bearing day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There shone a laughter in the singing stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the gold-ceil&egrave;d bride-bed wherein Mars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touched thee and had thee in your kissing wise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now therefore, sweet, kiss thou my maiden's eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they may open graciously towards me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this new fashion of thy shrine shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As soft with gold as thine own happy head.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The goddess, that was painted with face red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between two long green tumbled sides of sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stooped her neck sideways, and spake pleasantly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt have grace as thou art thrall of mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with this came a savour of shed wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plucked-out petals from a rose's head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And softly with slow laughs of lip she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt have favour all thy days of me.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then came Theophilus to Dorothy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying: O sweet, if one should strive or speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against God's ways, he gets a beaten cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all his wage and shame above all men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore I have no will to turn again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When God saith "go," lest a worse thing fall out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she, misdoubting lest he went about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch her wits, made answer somewhat thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have no will, my lord Theophilus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak against this worthy word of yours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing how God's will in all speech endures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That save by grace there may no thing be said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Theophile waxed light from foot to head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And softly fell upon this answering.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is well seen you are a chosen thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do God service in his gracious way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will that you make haste and holiday<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To go next year upon the Venus stair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covered none else, but crowned upon your hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do the service that a maiden doth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said: but I that am Christ's maid were loth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do this thing that hath such bitter name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat his brows were beaten with sore shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he came off and said no other word.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then his eyes chanced upon his banner-bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he fell fingering at the staff of it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughed for wrath and stared between his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out of a chafed heart he spake as thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo how she japes at me Theophilus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feigning herself a fool and hard to love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet in good time for all she boasteth of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shall be like a little beaten bird.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while his mouth was open in that word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He came upon the house Janiculum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where some went busily, and other some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talked in the gate called the gate glorious.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The emperor, which was one Gabalus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat over all and drank chill wine alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom is come Theophilus anon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said as thus: <i>Beau sire, Dieu vous aide</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And afterward sat under him, and said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this thing through as ye have wholly heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This Gabalus laughed thickly in his beard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, this is righteousness and maiden rule.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truly, he said, a maid is but a fool.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And japed at them as one full villainous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a lewd wise, this heathen Gabalus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sent his men to bind her as he bade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus have they taken Dorothy the maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And haled her forth as men hale pick-purses:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little need God knows they had of this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hale her by her maiden gentle hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus went she lowly, making a soft prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one who stays the sweet wine in his mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmuring with eased lips, and is most loth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have done wholly with the sweet of it.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Christ king, fair Christ, that knowest all men's wit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the feeble fashion of my ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O perfect God, that from all yesterdays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abidest whole with morrows perfected,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pray thee by thy mother's holy head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou help me to do right, that I not slip:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have no speech nor strength upon my lip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except thou help me who art wise and sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do this too for those nails that clove thy feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me die maiden after many pains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I be least among thy handmaidens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubtless I shall take death more sweetly thus.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now have they brought her to King Gabalus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who laughed in all his throat some breathing-whiles:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By God, he said, if one should leap two miles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He were not pained about the sides so much.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This were a soft thing for a man to touch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall one so chafe that hath such little bones?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shook his throat with thick and chuckled moans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For laughter that she had such holiness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What aileth thee, wilt thou do services?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It were good fare to fare as Venus doth.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then said this lady with her maiden mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shamefaced, and something paler in the cheek:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, sir, albeit my wit and will to speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me no grace in sight of worthy men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all my shame yet know I this again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may not speak, nor after downlying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise up to take delight in lute-playing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sing nor sleep, nor sit and fold my hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my soul in some measure understands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God's grace laid like a garment over me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this fair God that out of strong sharp sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted the shapely and green-coloured land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hath the weight of heaven in his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one might hold a bird, and under him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavy golden planets beam by beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Building the feasting-chambers of his house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the large world he holdeth with his brows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the light of them astonisheth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All place and time and face of life and death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And motion of the north wind and the south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is the sound within his angel's mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of singing words and words of thanksgiving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is the colour of the latter spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heat upon the summer and the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is beginning of all things begun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gathers in him all things to their end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the fingers of his hand doth bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stretched-out sides of heaven like a sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his breath he maketh the red pale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fills with blood faint faces of men dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the sound between his lips are fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iron and fire and the white body of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blossom of all trees in places low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And small bright herbs about the little hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fruit pricked softly with birds' tender bills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flight of foam about green fields of sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fourfold strength of the great winds that be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved always outward from beneath his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And growth of grass and growth of sheav&egrave;d wheat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all green flower of goodly-growing lands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all these things he gathers with his hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And covers all their beauty with his wings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same, even God that governs all these things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath set my feet to be upon his ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now therefore for no painfulness of days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall put off this service bound on me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also, fair sir, ye know this certainly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How God was in his flesh full chaste and meek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave his face to shame, and either cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave up to smiting of men tyrannous.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And here with a great voice this Gabalus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried out and said: By God's blood and his bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This were good game betwixen night and nones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one to sit and hearken to such saws:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I were as lief fall in some big beast's jaws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As hear these women's jaw-teeth clattering;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By God a woman is the harder thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One may not put a hook into her mouth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now by St. Luke I am so sore adrouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all these saws I must needs drink again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I pray God deliver all us men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all such noise of women and their heat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is a noble scripture, well I weet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That likens women to an empty can;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When God said that he was a full wise man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trow no man may blame him as for that.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And herewithal he drank a draught, and spat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: Now shall I make an end hereof.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come near all men and hearken for God's love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ye shall hear a jest or twain, God wot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake as thus with mouth full thick and hot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou do this thou shalt be shortly slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, sir, she said, this death and all this pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I take in penance of my bitter sins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea now, quoth Gabalus, this game begins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, without sin one shall not live a span.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, this is she that would not look on man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between her fingers folded in thwart wise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See how her shame hath smitten in her eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was so clean she had not heard of shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Certes, he said, by Gabalus my name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This two years back I was not so well pleased.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This were good mirth for sick men to be eased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rise up whole and laugh at hearing of.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pray thee show us something of thy love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since thou wast maid thy gown is waxen wide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, maid I am, she said, and somewhat sighed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one who thought upon the low fair house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she sat working, with soft bended brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching her threads, among the school-maidens.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she thought well now God had brought her thence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She should not come to sew her gold again.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then cried King Gabalus upon his men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have her forth and draw her with steel gins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as a man hag-ridden beats and grins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bends his body sidelong in his bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So wagged he with his body and knave's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaping at her, and blowing with his breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in good time he gat an evil death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of his lewdness with his curs&egrave;d wives:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bones were hewn asunder as with knives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his misliving, certes it is said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all the evil wrought upon this maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It were full hard for one to handle it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her soft blood was shed upon her feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all her body's colour bruised and faint.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she, as one abiding God's great saint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake not nor wept for all this travail hard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore the king commanded afterward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slay her presently in all men's sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it was now an hour upon the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winter-time, and a few stars began.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weather was yet feeble and all wan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For beating of a weighty wind and snow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she came walking in soft wise and slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many men with faces piteous.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came this heavy cursing Gabalus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That swore full hard into his drunken beard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And faintly after without any word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came Theophile some paces off the king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the middle of this wayfaring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full tenderly beholding her he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There is no word of comfort with men dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor any face and colour of things sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But always with lean cheeks and lifted feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These dead men lie all aching to the blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bitter cold, their brows withouten hood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beating for chill, their bodies swathed full thin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, what hire shall any have herein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give his life and get such bitterness?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also the soul going forth bodiless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is hurt with naked cold, and no man saith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there be house or covering for death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hide the soul that is discomforted.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then she beholding him a little said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, fair lord, ye have no wit of this;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For on one side death is full poor of bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as ye say full sharp of bone and lean:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on the other side is good and green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hath soft flower of tender-coloured hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grown on his head, and a red mouth as fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As may be kissed with lips; thereto his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is as God's face, and in a perfect place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of all sun and colour of straight boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waterheads about a painted house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hath a mile of flowers either way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outward from it, and blossom-grass of May<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thickening on many a side for length of heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath God set death upon a noble seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covered with green and flowered in the fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In likeness of a great king grown full old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gentle with new temperance of blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his brows a purfled purple hood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They may not carry any golden thing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plays some tune with subtle fingering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a small cithern, full of tears and sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heavy pleasure that is quick to weep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sorrow with the honey in her mouth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for this might of music that he doth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are all souls drawn toward him with great love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weep for sweetness of the noise thereof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bow to him with worship of their knees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the field is thick with companies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fair-clothed men that play on shawms and lutes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gather honey of the yellow fruits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the branches waxen soft and wide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all this peace endures in either side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the green land, and God beholdeth all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is girdled with a round fair wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made of red stone and cool with heavy leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grown out against it, and green blossom cleaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the green chinks, and lesser wall-weed sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kissing the crannies that are split with heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And branches where the summer draws to head.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Theophile burnt in the cheek, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, could one see it, this were marvellous.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pray you, at your coming to this house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me some leaf of all those tree-branches;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing how so sharp and white our weather is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no green nor gracious red to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yea, sir, she said, that shall I certainly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from her long sweet throat without a fleck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undid the gold, and through her stretched-out neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cold axe clove, and smote away her head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of her throat the tender blood full red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell suddenly through all her long soft hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with good speed for hardness of the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each man departed to his house again.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lo, as fair colour in the face of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At seed-time of their blood, or in such wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a thing seen increaseth in men's eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught first far off by sickly fits of sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So a word said, if one shall hear aright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abides against the season of its growth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Theophile went slowly, as one doth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is not sure for sickness of his feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And counting the white stonework of the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears fell out of his eyes for wrath and love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making him weep more for the shame thereof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than for true pain: so went he half a mile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And women mocked him, saying: Theophile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, she is dead; what shall a woman have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That loveth such an one? so Christ me save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I were as lief to love a man new-hung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely this man has bitten on his tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This makes him sad and writhled in his face.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And when they came upon the paven place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was called sometime the place amorous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came a child before Theophilus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing a basket, and said suddenly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair sir, this is my mistress Dorothy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sends you gifts; and with this he was gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all this earth there is not such an one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For colour and straight stature made so fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender growing gold of his pure hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was as wheat growing, and his mouth as flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God called him Holy after his own name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gold cloth like fire burning he was clad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for the fair green basket that he had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was filled up with heavy white and red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great roses stained still where the first rose bled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning at heart for shame their heart withholds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sad colour of strong marigolds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That have the sun to kiss their lips for love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flower that Venus' hair is woven of,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The colour of fair apples in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late peaches gathered when the heat was done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the slain air got breath; and after these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair faint-headed poppies drunk with ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaviness of hollow lilies red.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then cried they all that saw these things, and said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was God's doing, and was marvellous.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in brief while this knight Theophilus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is waxen full of faith, and witnesseth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the king of God and love and death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For which the king bade hang him presently.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gallows of a goodly piece of tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Gabalus hath made to hang him on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth of this world lo Theophile is gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a wried neck, God give us better fare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than his that hath a twisted throat to wear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But truly for his love God hath him brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There where his heavy body grieves him nought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor all the people plucking at his feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in his face his lady's face is sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through his lips her kissing lips are gone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God send him peace, and joy of such an one.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This is the story of St. Dorothy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will you of your mercy pray for me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I wrote these sayings for your grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may one day see her in the face.<br /></span>

<h4>(FROM BOCCACCIO)</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I will that if I say a heavy thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your tongues forgive me; seeing ye know that spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has flecks and fits of pain to keep her sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And walks somewhile with winter-bitten feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moreover it sounds often well to let<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One string, when ye play music, keep at fret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole song through; one petal that is dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confirms the roses, be they white or red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead sorrow is not sorrowful to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the thick noise that breaks mid weeping were;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sick sound aching in a lifted throat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns to sharp silver of a perfect note;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though the rain falls often, and with rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late autumn falls on the old red leaves like pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I deem that God is not disquieted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also while men are fed with wine and bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shall be fed with sorrow at his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There grew a rose-garden in Florence land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More fair than many; all red summers through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leaves smelt sweet and sharp of rain, and blew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sideways with tender wind; and therein fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet sound wherewith the green waxed audible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a bird's will to sing disturbed his throat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set the sharp wings forward like a boat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pushed through soft water, moving his brown side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooth-shapen as a maid's, and shook with pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His deep warm bosom, till the heavy sun's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set face of heat stopped all the songs at once.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ways were clean to walk and delicate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the windy white of March grew late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the trees took heart to face the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ravelled raiment of lean winter on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roots were thick and hot with hollow grass.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Some roods away a lordly house there was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cool with broad courts and latticed passage wet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From rush-flowers and lilies ripe to set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sown close among the strewings of the floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And either wall of the slow corridor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was dim with deep device of gracious things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some angel's steady mouth and weight of wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut to the side; or Peter with straight stole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beard cut black against the aureole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That spanned his head from nape to crown; thereby<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mary's gold hair, thick to the girdle-tie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein was bound a child with tender feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the broad cross with blood nigh brown on it.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Within this house a righteous lord abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ser Averardo; patient of his mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just of judgment; and to child he had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maid so sweet that her mere sight made glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men sorrowing, and unbound the brows of hate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where she came, the lips that pain made strait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waxed warm and wide, and from untender grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tender as those that sleep brings patience to.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such long locks had she, that with knee to chin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She might have wrapped and warmed her feet therein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right seldom fell her face on weeping wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold hair she had, and golden-coloured eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled with clear light and fire and large repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a fair hound's; no man there is but knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her face was white, and thereto she was tall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In no wise lacked there any praise at all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her most perfect and pure maidenhood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sin I think there was in all her blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She, where a gold grate shut the roses in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwelt daily through deep summer weeks, through green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flushed hours of rain upon the leaves; and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love made him room and space to worship her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tender worship of bowed knees, and wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such pleasure as the pained sense palates not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For weariness, but at one taste undoes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart of its strong sweet, is ravenous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the hidden honey; words and sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fail through the tune's imperious prevalence.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In a poor house this lover kept apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long communing with patience next his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If love of his might move that face at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tuned evenwise with colours musical;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then after length of days he said thus: "Love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For love's own sake and for the love thereof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let no harsh words untune your gracious mood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For good it were, if anything be good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To comfort me in this pain's plague of mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing thus, how neither sleep nor bread nor wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems pleasant to me, yea no thing that is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems pleasant to me; only I know this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love's ways are sharp for palms of piteous feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To travel, but the end of such is sweet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now do with me as seemeth you the best."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She mused a little, as one holds his guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the hand musing, with her face borne down:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then said: "Yea, though such bitter seed be sown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have no more care of all that you have said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since if there is no sleep will bind your head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, I am fain to help you certainly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christ knoweth, sir, if I would have you die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no pleasure when a man is dead."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat he kissed her hands and yellow head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clipped her fair long body many times;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have no wit to shape in written rhymes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A scanted tithe of this great joy they had.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They were too near love's secret to be glad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As whoso deems the core will surely melt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the warm fruit his lips caress, hath felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some bitter kernel where the teeth shut hard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or as sweet music sharpens afterward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being half disrelished both for sharp and sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sea-water, having killed over-heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a man's body, chills it with faint ache;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So their sense, burdened only for love's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Failed for pure love; yet so time served their wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They saved each day some gold reserves of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being wiser in love's riddle than such be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom fragments feed with his chance charity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things felt sweet were felt sweet overmuch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rose-thorn's prickle dangerous to touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flecks of fire in the thin leaf-shadows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too keen the breathed honey of the rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its red too harsh a weight on feasted eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were so far gone in love's histories,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond all shape and colour and mere breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where pleasure has for kinsfolk sleep and death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strength of soul and body waxen blind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For weariness, and flesh entailed with mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the keen edge of sense foretasteth sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Even this green place the summer caught them in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed half deflowered and sick with beaten leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their strayed eyes; these gold flower-fum&egrave;d eves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burnt out to make the sun's love-offering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The midnoon's prayer, the rose's thanksgiving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trees' weight burdening the strengthless air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shape of her stilled eyes, her coloured hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her body's balance from the moving feet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this, found fair, lacked yet one grain of sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It had some warm weeks back: so perisheth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On May's new lip the tender April breath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So those same walks the wind sowed lilies in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All April through, and all their latter kin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of languid leaves whereon the Autumn blows&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dead red raiment of the last year's rose&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last year's laurel, and the last year's love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fade, and grow things that death grows weary of.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What man will gather in red summer-time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fruit of some obscure and hoary rhyme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard last midwinter, taste the heart in it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mould the smooth semitones afresh, refit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair limbs ruined, flush the dead blood through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With colour, make all broken beauties new<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For love's new lesson&mdash;shall not such find pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the marred music labouring in his brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frets him with sweet sharp fragments, and lets slip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One word that might leave satisfied his lip&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One touch that might put fire in all the chords?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was her pain: to miss from all sweet words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some taste of sound, diverse and delicate&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some speech the old love found out to compensate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For seasons of shut lips and drowsiness&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some grace, some word the old love found out to bless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passionless months and undelighted weeks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flowers had lost their summer-scented cheeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their lips were no more sweet than daily breath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The year was plagued with instances of death.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So fell it, these were sitting in cool grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With leaves about, and many a bird there was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the green shadow thickliest impleached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft fruit and writhen spray and blossom bleached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dry in the sun or washed with rains to white:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her girdle was pure silk, the bosom bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With purple as purple water and gold wrought in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One branch had touched with dusk her lips and chin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made violet of the throat, abashed with shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breast's bright plaited work: but nothing frayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun's large kiss on the luxurious hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her beauty was new colour to the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And music to the silent many birds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love was an-hungred for some perfect words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To praise her with; but only her low name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Andrevuola" came thrice, and thrice put shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her clear cheek, so fruitful with new red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That for pure love straightway shame's self was dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then with lids gathered as who late had wept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She began saying: "I have so little slept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lids drowse now against the very sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, the brain aching with a dream begun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beats like a fitful blood; kiss but both brows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you shall pluck my thoughts grown dangerous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almost away." He said thus, kissing them:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O sole sweet thing that God is glad to name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My one gold gift, if dreams be sharp and sore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not the waking time increase much more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With taste and sound, sweet eyesight or sweet scent?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has any heat too hard and insolent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burnt bare the tender married leaves, undone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maiden grass shut under from the sun?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where in this world is room enough for pain?"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The feverish finger of love had touched again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lips with happier blood; the pain lay meek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her fair face, nor altered lip nor cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pallor or with pulse; but in her mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love thirsted as a man wayfaring doth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making it humble as weak hunger is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She lay close to him, bade do this and this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say that, sing thus: then almost weeping-ripe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crouched, then laughed low. As one that fain would wipe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old record out of old things done and dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rose, she heaved her hands up, and waxed red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wilful heart and blameless fear of blame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying "Though my wits be weak, this is no shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a poor maid whom love so punisheth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heats of hesitation and stopped breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with my dreams I live yet heavily<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pure sad heart and faith's humility.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now be not wroth and I will show you this.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Methought our lips upon their second kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Met in this place, and a fair day we had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair soft leaves that waxed and were not sad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shaken rain or bitten through with drouth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I, beholding ever how your mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waited for mine, the throat being fallen back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw crawl thereout a live thing flaked with black<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Specks of brute slime and leper-coloured scale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A devil's hide with foul flame-writhen grail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fashioned where hell's heat festers loathsomest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that brief speech may ease me of the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus were you slain and eaten of the thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My waked eyes felt the new day shuddering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On their low lids, felt the whole east so beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pant with close pulse of such a plague-struck heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the palpitating dawn drew breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For horror, breathing between life and death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the sun sprang blood-bright and violent."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So finishing, her soft strength wholly spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gazed each way, lest some brute-hoov&egrave;d thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The timeless travail of hell's childbearing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should threat upon the sudden: whereat he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For relish of her tasted misery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tender little thornprick of her pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughed with mere love. What lover among men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hath his sense fed sovereignly 'twixt whiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears and covered eyelids and sick smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soft disaster of a pain&egrave;d face?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What pain, established in so sweet a place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the plucked leaf of it smells fragrantly?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What colour burning man's wide-open eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But may be pleasurably seen? what sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeps in its hot sharp extreme violence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No savour of sweet things? The bereaved blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And emptied flesh in their most broken mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fail not so wholly, famish not when thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past honey keeps the starved lip covetous.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Therefore this speech from a glad mouth began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathed in her tender hair and temples wan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one prolonged kiss while the lips had breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sleep, that abides in vassalage of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in death's service wears out half his age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath his dreams full of deadly vassalage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadow and sound of things ungracious;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair shallow faces, hooded bloodless brows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mouths past kissing; yea, myself have had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As harsh a dream as holds your eyelids sad.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"This dream I tell you came three nights ago;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In full mid sleep I took a whim to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sweet things might be; so I turned and thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But save my dream all sweet availed me not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First came a smell of pounded spice and scent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as God ripens in some continent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of utmost amber in the Syrian sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breaths as though some costly rose could be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoiled slowly, wasted by some bitter fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To burn the sweet out leaf by leaf, and tire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flower's poor heart with heat and waste, to make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong magic for some perfumed woman's sake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a cool naked sense beneath my feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bud and blossom; and sound of veins that beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a lute should play of its own heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fearfully, not smitten of either part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all my blood it filled with sharp and sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As gold swoln grain fills out the husk&egrave;d wheat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I rose naked from the bed, and stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counting the mobile measure in my blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some pleasant while, and through each limb there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift little pleasures pungent as a flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt in the thrilling flesh and veins as much<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the outer curls that feel the comb's first touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrill to the roots and shiver as from fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blind between my dream and my desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seemed to stand and held my spirit still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest this should cease. A child whose fingers spill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honey from cells forgotten of the bee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is less afraid to stir the hive and see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some wasp's bright back inside, than I to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some finger-touch disturb the flesh like steel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I prayed thus; Let me catch a secret here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sweet, it sharpens the sweet taste of fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And takes the mouth with edge of wine; I would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have here some colour and smooth shape as good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As those in heaven whom the chief garden hides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With low grape-blossom veiling their white sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lesser tendrils that so bind and blind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their eyes and feet, that if one come behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To touch their hair they see not, neither fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This would I see in heaven and not die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So praying, I had nigh cried out and knelt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So wholly my prayer filled me: till I felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dumb night's warm weight of glowing gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhat that altered all my sleeping-room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made it like a green low place wherein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maids mix to bathe: one sets her small warm chin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against a ripple, that the angry pearl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May flow like flame about her: the next curl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dips in some eddy coloured of the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wash the dust well out; another one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holds a straight ankle in her hand and swings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lavish body sidelong, so that rings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sweet fierce water, swollen and splendid, fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All round her fine and floated body pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swayed flower-fashion, and her balanced side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swerved edgeways lets the weight of water slide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As taken in some underflow of sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swerves the banked gold of sea-flowers; but she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pulls down some branch to keep her perfect head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear of the river: even from wall to bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell you, was my room transfigured so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet, green and warm it was, nor could one know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there were walls or leaves, or if there was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No bed's green curtain, but mere gentle grass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were set also hard against the feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold plates with honey and green grapes to eat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the cool water's noise to hear in rhymes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a wind warmed me full of furze and limes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all hot sweets the heavy summer fills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the round brim of smooth cup-shapen hills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next the grave walking of a woman's feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made my veins hesitate, and gracious heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made thick the lids and leaden on mine eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I thought ever, surely it were wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not yet to see her: this may last (who knows?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five minutes; the poor rose is twice a rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because it turns a face to her, the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sings that way; hath this woman ever sinned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wonder? as a boy with apple-rind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I played with pleasures, made them to my mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changed each ere tasting. When she came indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First her hair touched me, then I grew to feed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the sense of her hand; her mouth at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touched me between the cheek and lip and past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over my face with kisses here and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sown in and out across the eyes and hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still I said nothing; till she set her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More close and harder on the kissing-place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her mouth caught like a snake's mouth, and stung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So faint and tenderly, the fang scarce clung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than a bird's foot: yet a wound it grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A great one, let this red mark witness you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the left breast; and the stroke thereof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So clove my sense that I woke out of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knew not what this dream was nor had wit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now God knows if I have skill of it."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hereat she laid one palm against her lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stop their trembling; as when water slips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of a beak-mouthed vessel with faint noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chuckles in the narrowed throat and cloys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The carven rims with murmuring, so came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Words in her lips with no word right of them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beaten speech thick and disconsolate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till his smile ceasing waxed compassionate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her sore fear that grew from anything&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sound of the strong summer thickening<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heated leaves of the smooth apple-trees:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day's breath felt about the ash-branches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And noises of the noon whose weight still grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the hot heavy-headed flowers, and drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their red mouths open till the rose-heart ached;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For eastward all the crowding rose was slaked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soothed with shade: but westward all its growth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to breathe hard with heat as a man doth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who feels his temples newly feverous.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even with such motion in her brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that man hath in whom sick days begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She turned her throat and spake, her voice being thin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a sick man's, sudden and tremulous;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sweet, if this end be come indeed on us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us love more;" and held his mouth with hers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the first sound of flooded hill-waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is heard by people of the meadow-grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ever a wandering waif of ruin pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With whirling stones and foam of the brown stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flaked with fierce yellow: so beholding him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She felt before tears came her eyelids wet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw the face deadly thin where life was yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard his throat's harsh last moan before it clomb:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he, with close mouth passionate and dumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned at her lips: so lay they without speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each grasping other, and the eyes of each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fed in the other's face: till suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cried out with a little broken cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This word, "O help me, sweet, I am but dead."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even so saying, the colour of fair red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was gone out of his face, and his blood's beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell, and stark death made sharp his upward feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pointed hands; and without moan he died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pain smote her sudden in the brows and side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strained her lips open and made burn her eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the pure sharpness of her miseries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had no heart's pain, but mere body's wrack;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at the last her beaten blood drew back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly upon her face, and her stunned brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly grown aware and piteous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathered themselves, her eyes shone, her hard breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came as though one nigh dead came back from death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lips throbbed, and life trembled through her hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And in brief while she thought to bury there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dead man that her love might lie with him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a sweet bed under the rose-roots dim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soft earth round the branch&egrave;d apple-trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of hushed heat and heavy with great ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no man entering divide him thence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore she bade one of her handmaidens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be her help to do upon this wise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saying so the tears out of her eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell without noise and comforted her heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, her great pain eased of the sorest part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to soften in her sense of it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There under all the little branches sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place was shapen of his burial;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shed thereon no thing funereal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But coloured leaves of latter rose-blossom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stems of soft grass, some withered red and some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair and fresh-blooded; and spoil splendider<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of marigold and great spent sunflower.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And afterward she came back without word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her own house; two days went, and the third<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
